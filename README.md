# DataCleaningPython_TableauVisualization
A Museum's messy data about its objects is available in MessyData_Sample.csv. The goal is to clean the data and then visualize it using Tableau.

## Techniques used for data cleaning
* Identify the null values and their percentage to total values
* Remove null values when they are insignificantly small. The null values are removed for the string type data.
* Repetitive values with pipe delimiter are restructured to a single value within a data frame
* Medium column contains description about composition of objects in the museum. The word frequency is calculated within the column to identify different types of "Medium".
